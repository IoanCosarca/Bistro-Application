* an endpoint to create customer
* an endpoint to GET all customers

Use spring-boot-starter-validation to validate the user's input. Use custom validators and Global Exception Handling to show to the end user the HTTP error code, status and a user-friendly message.

Use Swagger OpenAPI to document the REST API endpoints. Use javadoc to document all the application's functionalities.
